# Kryptos


## What this app does

This project aims to provide a simple, easy to use, and secure way to send/recieve messages between using a p2p network. It is designed around using a server as an intermediary between the two parties. The server is simply responsible for facilitating [tcp hole punching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_hole_punching) to bypass [NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation) limmitations.
